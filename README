This project tends to provide a web GUI for import/export sites which is, until now, already 
used with the command line. The later approach is not user friendly and not well adapted for
some users. The idea is to implement a GWT gadget to simplify the import/export task.

To install the application, follow the instructions below:

1) If you don't have maven installed yet, so start with downloading and installing 
   it, you find all steps for that in the link below, to ensure that it was 
   correctly installed, open a terminal window and type the following command :
   
   ~home$ mvn --version
   
   and you should have something like this (run on Mac OSX) :
   
      Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 21:16:01+0200)
      Java version: 1.6.0_22
      Java home: /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
      Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: MacRoman
      OS name: "mac os x" version: "10.6.6" arch: "x86_64" Family: "mac"
   
   
   NB : if you are using Windows OS, please refer to Maven website for more
        details about how to install and configure Maven.
   
   Download link : http://maven.apache.org/

2) Download the gadget source code from the github repository below:
   https://github.com/benothman/GateIn-Management-Gadget
   
3) Download the tow projects from github repositories below:
	* https://github.com/nscavell/stax-builder
   	* https://github.com/nscavell/gatein-management

4) Start by install the two projects above before installing gadget by typing the command
   below ( start by "stax-builder"! ) :

	~projectHome$ mvn clean install
   
5) Deploy the "gatein-management.ear" archive that you can find in 
   "~yourWorkSpace/gatein-management/packaging/jbossas/ear/target/gatein-management.ear"
   by copying it to your JBoss AS deploy directory

6) If you have server already running, you have to stop and restart it (hot dpeloy weakness!!)

7) Now you can build the gadget and deploy the war archive on your JBoss AS server.

8) Follow the GateIn tutorial to register the gadget and add it to a page.

   * Add the gadget as remote one using the url :
     http://localhost:8080/gwtgadget/gwtgadget/org.gatein.management.client.Application.gadget.xml
   
   * To see how to use GWT gadgets with GateIn, you can refer to the example below:
     http://community.jboss.org/wiki/GWTGadgetaccessingPortalServices
   
9) Once all the instruction are done, the gadget is ready for use.
